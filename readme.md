# Browser Fingerprinting Tool

This project provides a simple, yet comprehensive browser fingerprinting tool that generates a unique identifier for a user's browser without using any external libraries.

## Features

- Collects various browser and device characteristics
- Implements canvas and audio fingerprinting techniques
- Detects installed fonts
- Generates a SHA-256 hash as a unique identifier
- Works entirely client-side in the browser

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/browser-fingerprinting-tool.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd browser-fingerprinting-tool
   ```

3. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser or serve it using a local server.

## Usage

1. Include the `fp.js` script in your HTML file:

   ```html
   <script src="fp.js"></script>
   ```

2. The script will automatically run when the page loads, collecting fingerprint data and generating a unique identifier.

3. Open your browser's console to view the results:
   - The complete fingerprint data object
   - The SHA-256 hash of the fingerprint (unique identifier)

## Customization

You can modify the `fp.js` file to add or remove fingerprinting techniques as needed for your specific use case.

## Security and Privacy Considerations

This tool is intended for educational and research purposes. Be aware of legal and ethical considerations when implementing fingerprinting techniques in production environments. Always inform users about data collection and respect their privacy preferences.
